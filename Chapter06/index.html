            <p>This web map looks to display the annual number of visitors to some of the US National Parks. 
                The US National Park Service has parks all over the country, meaning no matter where you are, a National Park ma just be a couple hours drive away. 
                Shown are the top 20 most visited parks in 2021, and their annual visitors from the past 7 years to 2015. 
                In doing this, we can see the growth, or decline, in popularity of some parks over time.
                It can also be used to see the effects of the pandemic on the number of visitors to these parks, and the ability of the parks to rebound after the pandemic.</p>
